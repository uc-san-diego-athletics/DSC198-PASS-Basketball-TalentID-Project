## Project Description:

Are there diamonds in the rough?  

The UC Sand Diego basketball coaches have been trying to figure out how to get an advantage in recruiting. They know that being the newest D1 institution leaves them with a large disadvantage when it comes to notoriety and brand appeal. Like all college sports, talent wins. They talked as a group and figured their best chance for success is to find the best developmental players, knowing that the more established teams will overlook them or not want to take the time to develop them. But how do we know which players will project a higher probability of success greater than the most recent scouting rankings? They want you to investigate what correlations exist between high school stats and success in our conference. They also want to know how they can give value to these players to best understand how to allocate their scholarships. Is that player worth more than another because of a recruiting service ranking, or might another player of a lower rank have more value to us in the long run?
